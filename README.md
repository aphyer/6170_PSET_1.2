6170_PSET_1.2
=============

aphyer's submission for Pset 1.2

How to Use: click on squares to toggle alive/dead.  Click the START button to start the game playing.  Click the PAUSE button to pause it.

My additional feature was the ability to alter the speed the game ran at.  Use the SLOWER and FASTER buttons to speed up or slow down game speed (within limits).
